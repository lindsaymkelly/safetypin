# SafetyPin

Putting a visual spin on the saying "You're not alone".

SafetyPin is an app that allows users to share their location as allies so those who are feeling isolated or victimized can see that they are not alone. 

There are plenty of additional functionalities that this app would like to have (search for nearby events, messaging/community aspect) but the goal for the current two day hackathon is to show visualization of allies.
