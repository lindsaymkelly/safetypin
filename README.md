# SafetyPin

Deployed on [Heroku](http://safety-pin-app.herokuapp.com/)

Putting a visual spin on the saying "You're not alone".

In our current political climate, there are many different people who are feeling unsafe for a variety of reasons. These people walk through life not knowing who is on their side and who might secretly (or not so secretly) wish them harm. Those who wish to be allies might not know the best way to reach out and show their solidarity.

SafetyPin is an app that allows users to share their location and see other allies on the map so those who are feeling isolated or victimized can see that they are not alone. While we hope that people display their allyship in a variety of ways (especially through their actions) we find that visualization is often a great comfort to those in need.
